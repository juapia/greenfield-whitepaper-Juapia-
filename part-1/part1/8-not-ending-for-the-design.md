# 8 - "Not" Ending for the Design

Many details are not covered in Part 1. While some topics will be added and expanded in Part 3, some are very strategic items that shoot too far for the team to consider now.

For example, the "execute" trait of a data object. That concept points out that some data are runnable programs. Greenfield may create a more transparent computing environment. Users are comfortable using or devoting their data to particular programs stored on Greenfield because they can verify the program, they do not have to worry about the program may change after their confirmation, and they know the program can only run with their data in a trustful environment provided by Greenfield.

This particular function, together with other new features will be researched and studied with the future development of BNB Greenfield.
