# 4 - BNB Greenfield Core

### 4.1 The BNB Greenfield Blockchain

BNB Greenfield blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake based on Tendermint-consensus for its own network security. Blocks are created every 2 seconds on the Greenfield chain by a group of validators.

BNB will be the gas and governance token on this blockchain. There is a native cross-chain bridge between the Greenfield blockchain and BSC. The initial BNB will be locked on BSC and re-minted on Greenfield. BNB and data operation primitives can flow between Greenfield and BSC.

Total circulation of BNB will stay unchanged as it is now but flow among BNB Beacon Chain, BSC, and Greenfield.

The validator election and governance are based on a proposal-vote mechanism, which is revised based on Cosmos SDK's governance module: anyone can create and propose to become a validator, and the election into the active set will be based on the stake ranking (initially new validators may request the existing validator set's votes to be qualified for election). As validators will host all the critical metadata and respond to all data operation transactions, they should run professionally in terms of performance and stability.

To facilitate cross-chain operation and convenient asset management, the address format of the Greenfield blockchain will be fully compatible with BSC (and Ethereum). It also accepts EIP712 transaction signing and verification. These enable the existing wallet infrastructure to interact with Greenfield at the beginning naturally.

### 4.2 The Storage Providers, SPs

SPs play a different role from Greenfield validators, although the same organizations or individuals can run both SPs and validators if they follow all the rules and procedures to get elected.

SPs store the objects' real data, i.e. the payload data. Each SP runs its own object storage system. Similar to Amazon S3 and other object store systems, the objects stored on SPs are immutable. The users may delete and re-create the object (under the different ID, or under the same ID after certain publicly declared settings), but they cannot modify it.

SPs have to register themselves first by depositing on the Greenfield blockchain as their "Service Stake". Greenfield validators will go through a dedicated governance procedure to vote for the SPs of their election. SPs are encouraged to advertise their information and prove to the community their capability, as SPs have to provide a professional storage system with high-quality SLA.

SPs provide publicly accessible APIs for users to upload, download, and manage data. These APIs are very similar to Amazon S3 APIs so that existing developers may feel familiar enough to write code for it. Meanwhile, they provide each other REST APIs and form another white-listed P2P network to communicate with each other to ensure data availability and redundancy. There will also be a P2P-based upload/download network across SPs and user-end client software to facilitate easy connections and fast data download, which is similar to BitTorrent.

More SPs are welcome to ensure decentralization and data redundancy. But too many SPs may make SPs unable to make enough to sustain the business. Greenfield has an incentive design to make a proper number of SPs available. While SPs can choose to stay with the network or leave.

When the SPs join and leave the network, they have to follow a series of actions to ensure data redundancy for the users; otherwise, their "Service Stake" will be fined. This is achieved through the data availability challenge (described in detail in Part 3) and validator governance votes.

### 4.3 The Pair Synergy

Greenfield validators and SPs form a pair synergy to provide the whole storage service. Validators store the metadata and financial ledger with consensus, while SPs provide real data storage and downloading. Validators have the motivation to ensure enough good SPs to provide decent service, while users and SPs rely on a stable and decentralized Greenfield blockchain as a single source of truth on metadata.
