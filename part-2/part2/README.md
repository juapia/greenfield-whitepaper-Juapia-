# Showcases in Labs

The goal of the BNB Greenfield platform is to unleash the power of decentralized blockchain and storage technology on data ownership and data economy.

This part of the whitepaper is neither accurate as industrial designs nor serious as academic research. It just lists a few potential showcases that can be modeled upon BNB Greenfield in a “laboratory environment”. The showcases are used to inspire further experimentation and solid design to create the next generation of decentralized applications.
