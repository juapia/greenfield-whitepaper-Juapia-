# 12 - Showcases: Personal Data Market

This may be the most complicated problem to tackle nowadays: how to own your data, such as page views, registrations, clicks, behavior data, and much more. The ownership guarantees that no platforms (usually the monopoly ones) can abuse using it. Many laws are defined to punish misuse, but there are few proactive solutions.

BNB Greenfield poses for pioneering new angles to solve this: what if you can ask the applications to store all your data encrypted on Greenfield under your account, and only allow the processing of your data via a publicly readable code?

Let us check a specific scenario. A data market stores your past buy and sell orders on Greenfield, encrypted by your account's public key. Only your private key can decrypt and read it. However the data market application will like to read your data to recommend other items, meanwhile, another data agency would like to use this data to perform commercial research. Both of them are willing to pay you for their processing of your data. You tend to grant permission to them to read the data but worry they will do other things with your data. How can BNB Greenfield solve this?

This may not be day 1 implementation but BNB Greenfield targets to solve this trust computing problem by providing a verifiable computing runtime ("do not trust, verify").

In the above scenario, the data market application and the data agency may put the programs that need to read the users' data on Greenfield and share them with you or even the whole public. You can verify whether you are comfortable with what the programs do. Then you grant the read permission of this new object with a "[group-oriented](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/sec.1593)" encryption scheme to these programs. The data market and the data agency can pay you and then will run these programs to get the result on a verifiable sandbox of the runtime of Greenfield.

Once this model gets understood, a lot of enhancements can be done via modern cryptography to improve the user experience.

For example, the deal can be negotiated beforehand between you and the data market. Thus the grant of the permission and corresponding economic benefits exchange can happen within a smart contract to reduce the trust required. After the deal is achieved, the data will be saved via BLS-based encryption from the time it is generated. Either the data owner or the data market programs that the data owner approves (not the data market owner) can, and only those two can decrypt the data.

Many more infrastructures related to the scenario above are not considered in this paper yet but can be gradually designed and implemented on BNB Greenfield.
