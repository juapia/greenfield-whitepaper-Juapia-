### 11.1 Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Censorship

There is one job that benefits the most from the development of Social Media: Key Opinion Leaders, a.k.a KOLs. They publish opinions, articles, videos, and music works that please, influence and inspire people. KOLs create their own fandom and can make their fortune by using the attention and traffic of their fans.

However, there is an Achilles' heel for these KoLs: they cannot own their data and fan relationship if the platforms do not allow them to. We all know that you cannot change this, even if you are the president of the most powerful country in the world.

BNB Greenfield provides a convenient infrastructure to make the data fully owned by the creators. Meanwhile, dApps can still use such data, publish it to the public audience and maintain the social network. What is more, even the fandom relationship or social network graph can be saved on Greenfield as a type of data owned by the users. There is no single firm here that can block data access. The dApps just provide convenient UIs and toolings to facilitate information creation and propagation.

Another big advantage of Greenfield is that it makes it easy to create private fandoms by using the group features. For example, a KOL can create a special group for a special fandom. This group can be only operated by a smart contract on BSC and only allow addresses to join based on special credentials, such as holding a certain token or paying a subscription fee. These are all easy to implement with Greenfield.

### 11.2 Token Curated Registries

[Token Curated Registries](https://hackernoon.com/what-are-token-curated-registries-and-decentralized-lists-d33fa42ba167) were widely discussed and researched in 2018. But it didn't gain much recognition in the real use cases. One of the reasons may be that it is difficult and expensive to save the different lists and credibly present them.

BNB Greenfield provides a perfect solution for token-curated lists. A smart contract on BSC can bear the full governance and incentive logic of the registration, and meanwhile owns the rights to create objects of each list under the designated bucket for the business. The list of objects and fully tracked change history are priceless functions for such decentralized voting and governance ideas.
