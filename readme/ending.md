# Ending

Greenfield is a giant economy and ecosystem. There are still important components missing from the current versions,
e.g. the execution environment for the stored object to run. There are also features and interfaces not explained
clearly in all the details. So the real ending hasn't come as this paper will be revised as time goes on.

Although Greenfield, especially with its handy infrastructure, efficient performance, convenient APIs, and strong
cross-chain integration with a large DeFi system and compatibility, provides possibilities for new models of Web3, its
success largely depends on the application layer innovations from the developers and community. The openness of
Greenfield should be ensured on different levels of the systems and management.

At the end of the paper, we'd like to thank again the efforts and ideas from the below teams and communities (in no
particular order and definitely not an exhaustive, full list). BNB Greenfield stands on these giants' shoulders to
build.

1. Ethereum

2. Cosmos SDK

3. Superfluid

4. Amazon Web Services

5. MinIO, and other open-source storage systems

6. Filecoin, Arweave, StorJ, and other decentralized storage networks

7. Bitcoin, and

8. all the other folks and projects that strive for the new Web3 economy

Hope everyone enjoys this journey!
