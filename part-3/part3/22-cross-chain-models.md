# 22 - Cross-Chain Models

The Cross-chain framework has been introduced in Part 1. Here more details about the communication layer and economics will be explained.

### 22.1 Communication Channels and Packages

#### 22.1.1 Vote Poll

A new p2p communication across the cross-chain relayers will be introduced, called "Vote Poll". This Vote Poll will gossip about the signed votes within the network. To avoid message flooding, all the signed votes will expire after a fixed time. The Greenfield relayers can either put votes to or fetch votes from the poll and assemble it as cross-chain package transactions.

#### 22.1.2 Channel and Sequence

To allow multiplexing and replay attack resistance, "Channel" and "Sequence" concepts are introduced to manage any type of communication. Following is an example definition:

```go
type Package struct {
    PackType     uint8 // SYN, ACK or FAIL_ACK
    SrcChainId   uint16
    DstChainId   uint16
    Sequence     int64
    ChannelId    uint16
    Payload      []byte
    BLSSignature sdk.Sig
    BLSBits      sdk.Bits // indicate the signer of the package
}
```

The packages in the same channel must be processed in sequence, while they can be processed in parallel if they belong to different channels.

The operation messages on different Greenfield resources are mapped to different channels. For example, buckets and storage objects belong to different channels.

#### 22.1.3 Reliability Protocol

Here a protocol is defined to ensure reliable stream delivery of data between BSC and Greenfield.

The protocol must recover the scenarios when the cross-chain data is damaged, duplicated, or delivered out of order by the relayers. It assigns a sequence number to each package and requires a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the target chain. Here there are three kinds of packages:

1. SYN: the initial cross-chain packages started by either users or dApps.
2. ACK: the positive acknowledgment sent by the resource layer of the target chain.
3. FAIL\_ACK: the negative acknowledgment sent by the communication layer of the target chain, usually caused by damaged data or protocol inconsistency triggered by the edge case.

Each communication package must start with SYN and end with ACK or FAIL\_ACK. The handler code and contracts on each side must handle these primitives.

#### 22.1.4 Validator Update

With an aggregatable multi-signature scheme, e.g. BLS, the cross-chain can be quite light-weighted. However sufficient data must be appended onto the package to indicate the validators who sign the events, this can be achieved by combining a bitmap and a validator set on-chain. However the Greenfield validator set is volatile, Greenfield validators have to sync the information to BSC once there is an update about the Greenfield validator set. This is implemented by building a Greenfield light client on BSC, which is similar to the light client implemented for BNB Beacon Chain on BSC.

### 22.2 Economic

The Greenfield relayers play an important role in relaying inter-chain packages. A proper incentive is required to keep relayers making their long-term contribution.

#### 22.2.1 Fee and Reward of Cross-Chain Packages

Both SYN and ACK/FAIL\_ACK packages cost gas to relay, the users (or smart contracts) will need to pay the fee to cover both of them when they start the SYN cross-chain packages.

To encourage Greenfield relayers to sign cross-chain packages:

1. The package deliverer will get a fixed ratio of the relay fee as a reward.
2. The rest relay fee will be distributed equally among those who sign the vote.

#### 22.2.2 Race to Deliver Cross-Chain Packages

There are multiple Greenfield relayers, and they may compete to submit the aggregated multi-signed packages onto the Greenfield blockchain and BSC. To avoid racing transactions caused by the competition, which wastes gas, the relayers are rotated to relay transactions, e.g. taking shifts every 10 minutes. Each cross-chain package gets a timestamp, if it is not relayed within a limited delay when the designated relayer doesn't perform the duty, any other Greenfield relayers are allowed to relay such a package.

#### 22.2.3 Callbacks and Limited Gas

BSC dApps, i.e. smart contracts on BSC, are allowed to implement their own logic to handle ACK or FAIL\_ACK packages. The smart contracts can register callback functions to handle the ACK packages. As it is impossible for the cross-chain infrastructure to predict the gas consumption of the callback, a gas limitation estimate should be defined from the smart contracts that register the callbacks.

For any cross-chain packages that start from BSC, the smart contract needs to specify the gas limitation for the ACK or FAIL\_ACK package, the relayer fee is prepaid accordingly on BSC. Relayers may refund the excessive fees later.

#### 22.2.4 Cross-Chain Infrastructure Contracts on BSC

The cross-chain logic is also implemented on Greenfield as smart contracts. But these contracts will not be implemented on BSC as the genesis contract anymore, but just upgradeable contracts. The upgrade will be controlled by the agreement of the Greenfield validators through a governance process. The design can take full advantage of normal contracts, such as working around the 24k size limitation by delegating different logic to different implementation contracts.

### 22.3 Error and Failure Handling

There are errors and failures that can happen during cross-chain communication.

One type of error is from the cross-chain protocol itself and is marked by "FAIL\_ACK". This means the protocol itself meets some fatal errors, and it cannot complete the cross-chain package transport even before it touches the layer above the communication layer. It is usually caused by system bugs that result in data corruption or inconsistency.

The other type is the error above the communication layer, for example, the errors triggered by improper logic or bugs in the resource mirror layer or the application layer. Such cases should still return "ACK" at the communication layer, but the ACK package should contain enough information for the resource mirror layer or the application layer to recover to the original state.

_Figure 22.1 Cross-chain Error and Failure Handling_

When Greenfield emits an ACK or FAIL\_ACK package, the registered callbacks of BSC dApps (i.e. the smart contracts) will be called up to handle the package, but these functions may fail to handle the ACK/FAIL\_ACK packages due to the bugs or exceptions in the callbacks, these packages will be put under in another queue that belongs to the BSC dApps.

The corresponding BSC dApps can retry the package, e.g. with a higher gas limit, or just skip the package to tolerate failure, or even upgrade its contract to handle corner cases. The BSC dApps can not start new cross-chain packages if there are any pending failed packages in their queue. It asks the BSC dApps must handle the failed packages in sequence.

The communication layer can catch any exception thrown by the resource mirror layer or application layer, so that package delivery won't be blocked by any customized applications.
