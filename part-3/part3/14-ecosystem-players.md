# 14 - Ecosystem Players

There are several player roles for the whole Greenfield ecosystem.

### 14.1 Greenfield Validators

As a PoS blockchain, the Greenfield blockchain has its own validators. These validators are elected based on the Proof-of-Stake logic.

These validators are responsible for the security of the Greenfield blockchain. They get involved in the governance and staking of the blockchain. They form a P2P network that is similar to other PoS blockchain networks.

Meanwhile, they accept and process transactions to allow users to operate their objects stored on Greenfield. They maintain the metadata of Greenfield as the blockchain state, which is the control panel for both Storage Providers (SPs) and users. These two parties use and update these states to operate the object storage.

Greenfield validators also have the obligation to run the relayer system for cross-chain communication with BSC.

The network topology of Greenfield validators is similar to the existing secure validator setup of PoS blockchains. "Sentry Nodes" are used to defend against DDoS and provide a secure private network, as shown in the below diagram.

### 14.2 Storage Providers (SPs)

Storage Providers are professional individuals and organizations who run a series of services to provide data services based on the Greenfield blockchain.

Each SP should have a good connection with the Greenfield network by maintaining its own local full node so that it can watch the state change directly, index data properly, and send transaction requests timely.

Different SPs are interconnected as well via both REST APIs and a P2P network while providing services to users by responding to their requests in REST APIs or P2P RPCs.

The typical network topology of connected SPs is as the below figure.

SPs may provide plenty of convenient services for users and dApps to get data about Greenfield.

### 14.3 Greenfield dApps

Greenfield dApps are applications that provide functions based on Greenfield storage and its related economic traits to solve some problems of their users.

These dApps may interact with Greenfield or interact with both the Greenfield blockchain and the SPs, or most commonly, interact with Greenfield blockchain, SPs, and BSC.

The dApps can read data from all these data sources to facilitate users' interaction with the smart contracts and navigate them through the different kinds of use case scenarios.

In Greenfield, similar to other decentralized environments, dApps don't need to ask for registration but communicate with users' wallets to get users' instructions and other information.
